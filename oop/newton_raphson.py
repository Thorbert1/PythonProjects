# take a trinomial function f(x)
# differentiate it in respect to x
# substitute an initial value of x into f(x)
# substitute the value of x into the derivative of f(x)
# find the value of c, which is equal to f(x) - x f'(x)
# substitute the values of x, f(x), and f'(x) into a line equation f(x) = f'(x)x + c
# find the value of x when f(x) = 0 with x = -c / f'(x)
# plug the new value of x into f(x) and f'(x)
